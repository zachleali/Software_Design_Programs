# Software_Design_Programs
A collection of the programs written for Introduction to Software Design at The University of Iowa.

## Program 1: BankInheritance
BankInheritance demonstrates inheritance in java.  The program simulates a banker(the user) who can create three different bank accounts: Savings Account, Checking Account, and Loan Account.  The Account class is the super class with the savings, checking, and loan accounts being the subclasses.

## Program 2: BaseChangeGUI_Medium
BaseChangeGUI uses java swing to create a GUI that allows a user convert a number to any base from base 2 to base 32.  As of right now, the program does not convert between bases
for numbers with decimals.  

## Program 3: Computus
Computus is a program that allows the user to enter any year from zero to any large number and will print out the exact month and day of Easter based on the Gregorian calendar.  It also computes the number of times a specific day and month of Easter occurred from years 0-5,700,000.

## Program 4: ImageRotator
ImageRotator utilizes java.swing to create a GUI that allows a user to rotate an image 360 degrees continously with the ability to dynamically change the speed of the rotation.  It also allows the user to choose a specific angle in degrees to rotate the image.

## Program 5: PerfectNumbers
PerfectNumbers computes the perfect numbers from 1-1000 and prints out to console the factors added together to make the perfect number.  The program also contains the functionality to check whether a number is perfect and/or prime.
